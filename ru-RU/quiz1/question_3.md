--- choices ---

- ( ) First person


  --- feedback --- No, first person is where you see the world through the eyes of the player. You might see their hands or arms, or what they are holding, but you don't see the whole character.

  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) Second person


  --- feedback --- No, second person is where you see the world through the eyes of another character. This technique is sometimes used in cut scenes or flashbacks.

- (x) Third person


  --- feedback --- Yes, third person is where you see the world through a camera that looks at and follows the Player. You can create a third person perspective by making the Main Camera a child of the Player GameObject. --- /feedback ---

- ( ) Top down

  --- feedback --- No, top down is where you see the world from a birds-eye view, looking down on the Player and other GameObjects. --- /feedback ---
