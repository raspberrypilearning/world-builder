- (x) Texture

  --- feedback ---

  Yes, that's right. A Texture is a bitmap image such as a '.png' that can be created in an image editor. A Material uses a Texture, and other Assets and settings, to control the way a GameObject looks.

  **Tip:** You can create a bitmap image in an image editor, save it, and then use **Import New Asset...** to create a Texture.

- () Material

  --- feedback ---

  No, the assets in the screenshot are not materials themselves but they can be used in the creation of a material to control the way a GameObject looks.

- ( ) Image

  --- feedback ---

  No, Unity has a name for images that are imported into 3D projects to be wrapped around 3D objects.
