## Upgrade your project

If you have time you can upgrade to your project and add more features to your world. 

Here are some ideas you could try:
- Add walls around your world so that the player can't walk off the map.
- Make your plane bigger and add different areas to explore.
- If you made your own Player GameObject, add more detail to it. 
- Make more detailed scenery objects using 3D GameObjects with child objects. 
- Experiment with particle systems to create interesting effects in different areas of your map. 
- Adjust the player's movement and the camera angle to get the effect you want. 
- Click '+' in the Hierarchy, choose 'Light' and add a 'Directional Light' to light up part of your world.
