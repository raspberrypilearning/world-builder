## Share

If you are in a club, why not share your project with friends?

You could also show your family how your project works.

You can build your project as a 'WebGL' project and upload it to a website so others can try it out.

### Sharing your WebGL project

In the location where you chose to save your project you should see an `index.html` file, a `Build` directory and a `Template` directory.
