These two walls both use the same Asset to create a brick effect. What kind of Asset is it? 

![Side by side images of two walls with brick effect. One wall is grey and the other wall orange. This is the only difference.](images/two-walls.png)

--- choices ---

- (x) Texture

  --- feedback ---

  Yes, that's right. A Texture gives both the walls the same brick pattern. 

  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) Material

  --- feedback ---

  No, the two walls have different colours so they use different Materials. 

  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) Cube

  --- feedback ---

  No, a Cube GameObject can be used to create a wall but it needs something else to add a pattern. 

  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) Mesh

  --- feedback ---

  No, a Mesh describes a 3D shape in Unity. Something else is used to create a pattern like the brick effect.
