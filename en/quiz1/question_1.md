Imagine you have been asked to create a new video game. How could you get a graphical character for your player GameObject?

--- choices ---

- ( ) Combine 3D Objects to design a character from geometric shapes. 

  --- feedback ---

  This is a great way to create characters that can be made from 3D shapes, but it's not your only option.

- ( ) Create a model in a 3D modelling tool and import it into Unity.

  --- feedback ---

You can create models using a 3D modelling tool such as Blender but that's not the only way you can get a model for your character. 

  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) Use a Unity model asset that someone else has created and you have permission to reuse.

  --- feedback ---

You can use Unity model assets created by others if you have permission. The Unity Asset Store has lots of free and paid assets. If you are under 18 then you will need support from a parent or guardian to use the Unity Asset Store.

- (x) All of the above.

  --- feedback ---
Yes, these are all ways to find or create a graphical character to use in Unity. Some people specialise in developing 3D models while others prefer to use models created by other people.
