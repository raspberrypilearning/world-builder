## Theme your world

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
What will your world be like? The material you choose for the ground will set the scene and you will choose or create a player character.

Think about the kind of world you want to make: 

+ What kind of biome, habitat, geography, or weather system will it have?
+ Will it be based on somewhere in the real world, an imagined planet, or based on a book or movie you enjoy?

Think of a **name** for your world.

**Choose:**

Open your Introduction to Unity project containing the scenes you created in the three Explore projects in this path. 

Or

Download and unzip the [Unity starter package](https://rpf.io/p/en/world-builder-go){:target="_blank"} to your computer. Choose a sensible location such as your Documents folder. Create a new 3D Unity project and import the starter package.

**Choose:**

You can either create a new empty scene in the project, or save a copy of your Star collector scene with a new name. 

Name the new scene with the name of your world.

Right-click on your **NPC scene** and choose **Save As**. 

Delete any GameObjects that you don't want in your new world. If you think you might want to use a GameObject later, you can deactivate it by unchecking the box next to its name in the Inspector.

Your world or map will need a floor or ground for the player to walk on.

--- task ---

If you're starting from a new scene, add a plane for the floor. If you're working on an existing scene, you can just change the material or size.

title: Add a plane
---

Right-click on your scene in the Hierarchy window and select **GameObject** then **3D Object** then **Plane**. 

![The 3D object menu with 'plane' highlighted.](images/3D-plane.png)

The default size for the plane is 10m Ã— 10m. Unity uses metres as the unit of measurement.

You can change the x and z Scale properties for the Plane's Transform in the Scene view or in the Inspector.

What kind of character will the Player be in your world? We have included some animal and car model objects that you can choose from. Alternatively, you can make a character from a 3D GameObject with child objects that move together. 

![A strip of images showing different characters. There are characters built from 3D GameObjects, and characters from models such as the cat, raccoon, and cars.](images/player-examples.png)

--- task ---

If you made a copy of an existing scene but want a different player character:
+ Drag the Main Camera from the existing Player to the top level in the Hierarchy, then
+ Delete the Player GameObject. 

Models can be created in 3D modelling tools such as Blender. You can also reuse existing Models if you have permission. To save time, we recommend that you use one of the models we have provided, or design your own GameObject using 3D shapes in Unity.

**Choose:**

title: Create a GameObject from a model

Navigate to the Model you want to use in the Project window. 

Drag the Model to your scene. 

![The Scene view with the Raccoon model added.](images/raccoon-character.png)

Name the new GameObject `Player` and add the Player tag. 

![The Inspector window for the Player character. The model has been remnamed 'Player' and the tag has been updated to show 'Player'.](images/player-tag.png)

Adjust the start position of the Player's Transform. 

If you use the Cat or Raccoon, decide which accessories you will enable, then disable the others by unchecking the box next to their name in the Inspector.

Create an 'Empty' 3D object to represent the player. 

![The Hierarchy window with right-click menu expanded and 'Create Empty' selected.](images/empty-object.png)

Name the new GameObject `Player` and add the Player tag.  

![The Inspector window for the Player character. The model has been renamed 'Player' and the tag has been updated to show 'Player'.](images/player-tag.png)

Right-click on the Player and add other 3D shapes from **Create** > **3D Object** as child GameObjects. The child objects will move with the Player GameObject. 

This character has a 'Capsule' body with child GameObjects that are 'Spheres' and 'Cylinders'. The shapes have been renamed to represent their body part.

You can change the **Tiling** properties for the material, or for a material used in a GameObject. Choose bigger tiling numbers to create a smaller pattern.

title: I deleted the Camera!

If your Camera is a child of the Player and you delete the Player, then you will also delete the Camera.

To add a new Camera, right-click in the Hierarchy and choose Camera. 

You can drag this Camera to be a child of your Player and adjust the settings.
