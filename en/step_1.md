## Introduction

Use your Unity skills to design and build an 3D world with a player character of your choice. 

You will build on this world in the next two projects in the [Introduction to Unity path](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/raspberrypi/unity-intro).

<span style="color: #0faeb0">**World building**</span> is imagining an environment and then making it come to life. World building can involve storytelling, visual design, map making and character design. In Unity you can imagine a 3D world and then make it so that others can experience it. 
</p>

You will:
+ Choose a 3D Player character (use a provided model or make your own from 3D GameObjects)
+ Build a 3D environment using 3D GameObjects and Particle Systems
+ Decide on camera settings and movement controls for your Player character

### Try it 

Click on the embedded project and navigate through the example world. 

Think about the GameObjects including their shape, materials and positions. 
+ Does the character fit the theme? 
+ How have the structures been created?
