## You will make

Use your Unity skills to design and build a 3D world with a Player character of your choice. 

You will build on this world in the next two projects in the [Introduction to Unity](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/raspberrypi/unity-intro){:target='_blank'} pathway.

This project is brought to you with generous support from [Unity Technologies](https://unity.com/){:target="_blank"}.  These [projects](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/unity-intro){:target="_blank"} offer young people the opportunity to take their first steps in creating virtual worlds using Real-Time 3D.

<span style="color: #0faeb0">**World building**</span> is imagining an environment and then making it come to life. World building can involve storytelling, visual design, map making, and character design. In Unity you can imagine a 3D world and then make it so that others can experience it. 
</p>

You will:
+ Choose a 3D Player character (use a provided model or make your own from 3D GameObjects)
+ Build a 3D environment using 3D GameObjects and Particle Systems
+ Decide on camera settings and movement controls for your Player character

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 175px; flex-grow: 1">  

Click on the embedded project and navigate through the example world. 

Think about the GameObjects, including their shape, materials, and positions. 
+ Does the character fit the theme? 
+ How have the structures been created?
